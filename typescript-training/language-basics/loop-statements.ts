//Loop Statements: Loop the statements or repeat the execution of statements multiple times based on the conditions given

//1.for loop:When we know the total numbers of iterations to be executed before itself, we use for loop.
//2.while loop: When we don't know the total number of iterations to be executed before itself, we use a while loop.

//1.for loop

//syntax

//for(condition-to-start;; condition-to-end; increment/decrement)
{
    //statements
}

//example: Print the name Manoj for 10 times using for loop

let empName:string="Manoj";
for(let i:number=1;i<=10;i++){
    console.log(i+empName);
}

//2.while loop
//syntax:
//while(condition0)
{
    //statements
}

//example: Refresh the page until the application is launched succesfully.

let counter:number=1;
while (counter>0) {
    let isPageLoaded: boolean=false; //assume this value is coming from application

    if(isPageLoaded || counter===10){
        break; //terminate the loop when the page is loaded or not loaded even after 10 attempts
    }
    
    console.log("Refresh the page");
    counter++;
}
