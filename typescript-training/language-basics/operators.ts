//operators : operators are special characters that we are going to use to perform different types of operations

//There are mainly five different types of operators in TypeScript and JavaScript.

//1.Arithmetic Operators
//2.Assignment Operators
//3.Comparison Operators
//4.Logical Operators
//5.Conditional Operators

//1.Arithmetic Operators: These operators are used to perfrom mathematical operations.
//+ Addition
//- Subtraction
//* Multiplication
/// Division
//% Modulus
//++ Increment (x++ ==> post increment, ++x ==> pre increment)
//-- Decrement (x-- ==> post decrement, --x ==> pre decrement)
let a:number=10;
let b:number=15;
console.log("Addition:",(a+b));
console.log("Subtraction:", (a-b));
console.log("Multiplication:",(a*b));
console.log("Division:", (a/b));
console.log("Modulus:", (a%b));
console.log("Post Increment:",(a++));
console.log("After next line of post increment",(a));
console.log("Pre Increment",(++b));
console.log("After next line of pre increment",(b));
console.log("Post Decrement",(a--));
console.log("After next line of post decrement",(a));
console.log("Pre Decrement", (--b));
console.log("After next line of post decrement",(b));

//2.Assignment Operators: These operators are used to assign values to variables.
// = Assignment
//+= Addition Assignment
//-= Subtraction Assignment
//*= Multiplication Assignment
///= Division Assignment
//%= Modulus Assignment

let c:number = 20;
c+=10;//c=c+10;
console.log("Addition Assignment:", c);
c-=5;// c=c-5;
console.log("Subtraction Assignment:", c);
c*=2;//c=c*2;
console.log("Mutliplication Assignment:", c);
c/=4;//c=c/4;
console.log("Division Assignment:", c);
c%=3;//c=c%3;
console.log("Modulus Assignment:", c);

//3.Comparison Operators: These operators are used to compare two values.
//== Equal to (Loose equality) (only compares values, perform type coercion)
//=== Strict Equal to
//> Greater than
//< Less than
//>= Greater than or equal to
//<= Less than or equal to

let x: number=10;
let y: any ="10";
console.log("Equal to (loose):",(x==y));
console.log("Strict Equal to:", (x===y));
console.log("Not Equal to (loose)",(x!=y));
console.log("Strict Not Equal to", (x!==y));
console.log("Greater than:",(x>5));
console.log("Less than:",(x<15));
console.log("Greater than or equal to:",(x>=10));
console.log("Less than or equal to:",(x<=20));

//4.Logical Operators: These operators are used to combine multiple conditions.
//&& Logical AND
//|| Logical OR
//! Logical NOT

let i:number =10;
let j:number =20;
console.log("Logical AND:",(i>5 && j>15));//true and true = true
console.log("Logical OR",(i>15 || j>15));//false or true = true
console.log("Logical NOT:",!(i>5));// not true = false

//5. Conditional (Ternary) Operator: This operator is used to evaluate a condition and return one of two values based on the result of the condition.
//condition ? valueIfTrue : valueIfFalse
let age:number = 17;
let canVote: string = (age >= 18) ? "Yes, you can vote." : "No, you cannot vote.";
console.log("Can Vote: " + canVote);

let age1:number=22;
let validAgeToGetMarried:string=(age1>=23)? "Yes, can get married":"No,You are not ready.";
console.log("Valid Age To Get Married:", validAgeToGetMarried);
